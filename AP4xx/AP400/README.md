__Notes__

```
The Canon AP400 typewriter in which it was discovered bears the Alps keyboard codes 12KF006C and KFFBA010; from this, (S)KFF was deduced. The Apple III service manual was subsequently found to cite these switches as "KFF". However, they remain listed here as SKFF until Alps's apparent inconsistent naming is better understood.
